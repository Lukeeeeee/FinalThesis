    With the development of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, as an important method in this field, have showed its great potential in field like Go. As a decision-making and control schema, reinforcement learning also can be applied in route planning system, which is a widely used system in navigation system … In our work, we applied reinforcement learning to route planning problem and solved various scenarios, especially for the scenario that traditional search-based route planning algorithms like Dijkstra and  search can’t solve. 
    
    The content of the dissertation is divided into three parts, firstly, we give the mathematical formulation of route planning problem, and adapted it into Markov Decision Process. Then we adapted it to different scenarios with modification of original formulation. At last, we compared our reinforcement learning based method with search based method which regard as the baseline under different experiments.
    
    Our main contributions are 1) firstly applied reinforcement learning into online-routing service 2) showed the flexibility of reinforcement learning with different metric function, scenarios and even dynamics environment.
